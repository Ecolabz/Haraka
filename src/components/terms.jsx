          <h3>Section 3: Ordering</h3>
          <p>
            3.1. By placing an order through our Website, Haraka acts as a
            marketplace with respect to the processing of that order and will
            forward it to the relevant Provider and / or Delivery Provider. By
            placing an order through the Haraka platform or app, you enter into
            an agreement with the Partner and the Delivery Partner for the
            purchase of Goods, Services and Delivery services. Both the
            transaction for Goods or Services via the Haraka website and any
            related delivery charge, are transactions with the Partner or seller
            of the Goods and Services, the third Party Delivery Partner, and
            You.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.2 Harakaâ€™s role is to act as an agent for both the seller of the
            Goods and Services and the Delivery Partners. We commit to using the
            Haraka platform to try to make ordering and delivering Goods and
            Services more efficient, transparent and fair for both buyers and
            sellers.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.3. Haraka also takes responsibilty to handle payments on behalf of
            you, and the Partner and Delivery Partner, to ensure that Partners
            and Delivery Partners are only paid once the customer (you) receive
            the goods or services ordered. If you are paying online, Haraka is
            also responsible for any returns or refunds. However, the Partner
            remains responsible for the preparation, quality and delivery of
            your order. You agree to take particular care when providing us with
            your details and warrant that these details are accurate and
            complete at the time of ordering. You also warrant that the credit
            or debit card details that you provide are for your own credit or
            debit card and that you have sufficient funds to make the payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.4. In case you chose to pay with a debit or credit card you
            warrant that you are the legal holder of the card and the funds
            backing it. You should also warrant that you have sufficient funds
            to make the payment.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">

            from this Website are intended for your use only. Resale of any of
            such Goods and Services or Food Delivery or acting as an agent for a
            third party is forbidden under this agreement. Only when acting as a

            and the Partner. Once you place an order online, we will send you an
            email or app notification to confirm that we have received it. This
            confirmation will be produced automatically and will just give you
            confirmation of your order details so that you can check that all
            details are correct. The fact that you receive an automatic
            confirmation does not necessarily mean that either we or the Partner
            will be able to fill your order. Once we have sent the confirmation
            email we will check availability and delivery capacity.
          </p>

            contract it will confirm it to Haraka. If the details of the order
            are correct, the contract will be confirmed.

          <p>
            3.10. In the case that Goods offered by Haraka were ordered, Haraka
            will confirm availability together with or separately from the
            Partner. 3.11. The confirmation message will specify delivery
            details including the approximate delivery time specified by the
            Partner and confirm the price of the Food Delivery, Goods and

            there is no delivery capacity, we will also let you know by message
            or phone call.

            10.1. Great care has been taken to ensure that the information
            available on this website is correct and error free. If it came to
            occur, we apologize for any errors or omissions that we might
            publish in our website. We cannot warrant that use of the Website
            will be error free or fit for purpose. We will make our best to
            correct such errors in a timely and effective manner. Also, neither
            can we warrant that the site or the server that makes it available
            are free of viruses or bugs or represents the full functionality,
            accuracy, reliability of the Website and we do not make any warranty
            whatsoever, whether express or implied, relating to fitness for
            purpose, or accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.2. By accepting these terms of use you agree to relieve us from
            any liability whatsoever arising from your use of information from
            any third party, or your use of any third party website, or your
            consumption of any food or beverages from a Partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.3. We disclaim any and all liability to you for the supply of the
            Food Delivery, Goods and Services to the fullest extent permissible
            under applicable law. This does not affect your statutory rights as
            a consumer. If we are found liable for any loss or damage to you
            such liability is limited to the amount you have paid for the
            relevant Goods or Services. We cannot accept any liability for any
            loss, damage or expense, including any direct or indirect loss such
            as loss of profits to you, howsoever arising. This limitation of
            liability does not apply to personal injury or death arising as a
            direct result of our negligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.4. We do not accept any liability for any delays, failures,
            errors or omissions or loss of transmitted information, viruses or

          <p>
            10.5. We shall not be held liable for any failure or delay in
            performing Services or delivering Goods where such failure arises as
            a result of any act or omission, which is outside our reasonable
            control such as all overwhelming and unpreventable events caused
            directly and exclusively by forces of nature that can be neither
            anticipated, nor controlled, nor prevented by the exercise of
            prudence, diligence, and care, including but not limited to: war,
            riot, civil commotion; compliance with any law or governmental
            order, rule, regulation or direction and acts of third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.6. If we have contracted to provide identical or similar order to
            more than one customer and are prevented from fully meeting our
            obligations to you by reason of an Event of Force Majeure, we may
            decide at our absolute discretion which orders we will fill and to
            what extent.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.7. The products sold by us are provided for private domestic and
            consumer use only. Accordingly, we do not accept liability for any
            indirect loss, consequential loss, loss of data, loss of income or
            profit, loss of damage to property and/or loss from claims of third
            parties arising out of the use of the Website or for any products or
            services purchased from us.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.8. We have taken all reasonable steps to prevent Internet fraud
            and ensure any data collected from you is stored as securely and
            safely as possible. However, we cannot be held liable in the
            extremely unlikely event of a breach in our secure computer servers
            or those of third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.9. In the event Haraka has a reasonable belief that there exists
            an abuse of vouchers and/or discount codes or in suspected instances
            of fraud, Haraka may cause the shopper (or customer) to be blocked
            immediately and reserves the right to refuse future service.
            Additionally, should there exist an abuse of vouchers or discount
